# Meta Tic-Tac-Toe

An implementation of Meta Tic-Tac-Toe, 
described in this [article](http://www.alaricstephen.com/main-featured/2016/11/11/meta-tic-tac-toe),
using [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) and [Incr_dom](https://opensource.janestreet.com/incr_dom/).

See this [commit](https://github.com/dmoon1221/ttt/commit/07b14e8b233e06e59dda47be5b8923537cffb946)
to see how the project was refactored from regular Tic-Tac-Toe to Meta Tic-Tac-Toe.
